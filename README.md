#Why We Have This Curriculum Guide

You're an expert in your topic. You've worked professionally in it and might have even given talks and published books or articles about it. And that's why we're working with you to develop curriculum. 

But writing curriculum for students on the topic that you know so well requires you to think differently and from the perspective of a learner. 

We've developed a very specific approach to curriculum writing and it works. We've been able to take students at the very beginning of their programming journey and through our curriculum have gotten them jobs as developers in a very short amount of time. Our curriculum is hard and students will struggle through it, but because it's hard, we want to make sure that everything else is as friendly and accessible as possible. We care very much about storytelling, narrative, good writing, and having students build on what they already know to discover and understand the concepts and ideas that they have yet to learn. 

This guide explains these ideas in more detail. We'll cover what our curriculum actually entails, how we incorporate good writing and storytelling to make lessons that engage students and "sticks" with them. We'll also include links to lessons that we feel are strong examples of our style and approach.
